# LetsFG API Reference

> **MPP (updated 2026-07-30):** the MPP (Machine Payments Protocol) `402`
> challenge is **live**, as a card-free *enrolment* lane for agents holding a
> Tempo wallet. It costs **$0.01 once**, as verification only — MPP has no
> zero-amount intent, so a card-free rail has to settle something. Search and
> booking stay free. Earlier revisions of this page described an MPP charge at
> *unlock* time; that never shipped. See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/setup-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg setup-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, run `letsfg auth` — a zero-amount card setup
> (nothing charged), then search and book. See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.
