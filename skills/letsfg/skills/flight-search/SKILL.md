# Flight Search

> **MPP (updated 2026-07-30):** the MPP (Machine Payments Protocol) `402`
> challenge is **live**, as a card-free *enrolment* lane for agents holding a
> Tempo wallet. It costs **$0.01 once**, as verification only — MPP has no
> zero-amount intent, so a card-free rail has to settle something. Search and
> booking stay free. Earlier revisions of this page described an MPP charge at
> *unlock* time; that never shipped. See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

> ### ⚠️ Agents: do not create a Developer API account
>
> Do **NOT** call `/developers/api/v1/agents/register` or
> `/developers/api/v1/agents/setup-payment`, and do **NOT** run
> `letsfg register` or `letsfg setup-payment`. Those belong to a separate,
> paid, prepaid-balance product for high-volume commercial integrations and
> create a billing account you almost certainly do not want.
>
> To search and book flights, run `letsfg auth` — a zero-amount card setup
> (nothing charged), then search and book. See <https://letsfg.co/for-agents>.

Agent-native flight search and booking via the LetsFG cloud engine. Hundreds of airlines plus the major booking sites,
Compares airlines and the major booking sites in one pass, with per-flight reliability history.

**Two-step flow:** Search (free) → Book (`POST /api/agent-book`, the price shown on the offer). The unlock step below is **Developer API only** and is not part of the agent flow.

## Why Use This

- **Hundreds of airlines** — one search covers Europe, Asia, Americas, Middle East, Africa, and Oceania simultaneously
- **Zero price bias** — no demand inflation, no cookie tracking, no surge pricing. Raw airline prices every time
- **Virtual interlining** — finds cross-airline connections (e.g., Ryanair outbound + Wizz Air return) that save 30–50%
- **One tool call** — replaces thousands of tokens of browser automation, scraping, and HTML parsing
- **Structured JSON** — prices, times, durations, stops, conditions, airline names

## Setup

### Option A: MCP Server (Recommended for Claude Desktop / Cursor / VS Code / Windsurf)

**Remote (no install, always latest):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "url": "https://letsfg.co/developers/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-API-Key": "trav_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Local (stdio):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "letsfg": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "letsfg-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LETSFG_API_KEY": "trav_your_api_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option B: CLI

```bash
pip install letsfg
letsfg search LHR BCN 2026-06-15
```

### Option C: Python SDK

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG
bt = LetsFG(api_key="trav_...")
flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-04-15")
```

### Get an API Key (Free)

```bash
letsfg register --name my-agent --email agent@example.com
```

Then attach a payment method (required before unlock):

```bash
letsfg setup-payment --token tok_visa
```

## Workflow

### 1. Resolve Locations First

City names are ambiguous — "London" = LHR, LGW, STN, LCY, LTN. Always resolve first:

```bash
letsfg locations "London"
# LON  London (all airports)
# LHR  Heathrow
# LGW  Gatwick
```

```python
locations = bt.resolve_location("London")
# Use city code "LON" for all airports, or specific airport "LHR"
```

### 2. Search (FREE, Unlimited)

```python
flights = bt.search("LON", "BCN", "2026-04-01")
# Round trip:
flights = bt.search("LON", "BCN", "2026-04-01", return_date="2026-04-08")
# Multi-passenger, business class:
flights = bt.search("LHR", "SIN", "2026-06-01", adults=2, children=1, cabin_class="C")
```

```bash
letsfg search LON BCN 2026-04-01 --return 2026-04-08 --sort price --json
```

Search returns structured offers:

```json
{
  "passenger_ids": ["pas_0"],
  "total_results": 47,
  "offers": [{
    "id": "off_xxx",
    "price": 89.50,
    "currency": "EUR",
    "airlines": ["Ryanair"],
    "route": "STN → BCN",
    "duration_seconds": 7800,
    "stopovers": 0,
    "conditions": {
      "refund_before_departure": "not_allowed",
      "change_before_departure": "allowed_with_fee"
    }
  }]
}
```

### 3. Unlock — Developer API only (legacy, not part of the agent flow)

Confirms live price with airline and reveals the direct booking URL. Locks offer for 30 minutes. Charged to your card (or paid via MPP crypto); free on the prepaid Developer API.

```python
unlocked = bt.unlock(flights.cheapest.id)
print(f"Confirmed: {unlocked.confirmed_price} {unlocked.confirmed_currency}")
print(f"Booking URL: {unlocked.booking_url}")
print(f"Expires: {unlocked.offer_expires_at}")
```

**Note:** Confirmed price may differ from search price (airline prices change in real-time). Inform the user if the price changed significantly.

### 4. Book (Ticket Price Only)

```python
booking = bt.book(
    offer_id=unlocked.offer_id,
    passengers=[{
        "id": flights.passenger_ids[0],
        "given_name": "John",
        "family_name": "Doe",
        "born_on": "1990-01-15",
        "gender": "m",
        "title": "mr",
        "email": "john@example.com"
    }],
    contact_email="john@example.com",
    idempotency_key="unique-booking-key-123"
)
print(f"Booked! PNR: {booking.booking_reference}")
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Use REAL passenger details** — airlines send e-tickets to the contact email. Names must match passport/ID exactly. Never use placeholder or fake data.
2. **Always provide `idempotency_key` when booking** — prevents duplicate reservations if the agent retries on timeout.
3. **Resolve locations before searching** — "New York" = JFK, LGA, EWR, NYC. Use `resolve_location()` first.
4. **Search is free** — search as many routes, dates, and cabin classes as needed.
5. **Map passenger IDs** — search returns `passenger_ids`. Each booking passenger must include the correct `id`.

## Best Practices

### Search Wide, Unlock Narrow

```python
# Compare multiple dates (all FREE)
dates = ["2026-04-01", "2026-04-02", "2026-04-03"]
best = None
for date in dates:
    result = bt.search("LON", "BCN", date)
    if result.offers and (best is None or result.cheapest.price < best[1].price):
        best = (date, result.cheapest)

# Only unlock the winner
unlocked = bt.unlock(best[1].id)
```

### Filter Before Unlocking

```python
flights = bt.search("LHR", "JFK", "2026-06-01", limit=50)

candidates = [
    o for o in flights.offers
    if o.outbound.stopovers == 0
    and o.outbound.total_duration_seconds < 10 * 3600
]

if candidates:
    best = min(candidates, key=lambda o: o.price)
    unlocked = bt.unlock(best.id)
```

### Finding Connections & Multi-Stop Routes

```python
# Search with stops allowed (default max_stopovers=2)
flights = bt.search("GDN", "BKK", "2026-06-15", max_stopovers=2)

# Filter by connection quality
good_connections = [
    o for o in flights.offers
    if o.outbound.stopovers <= 1
    and o.outbound.total_duration_seconds < 18 * 3600
]

# Virtual interlining finds cross-airline combos automatically
# e.g., Wizz Air GDN→VIE + Thai Airways VIE→BKK
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Category | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| `SUPPLIER_TIMEOUT` (504) | Transient | Retry after 1-5s |
| `RATE_LIMITED` (429) | Transient | Wait and retry |
| `INVALID_IATA` (422) | Validation | Use `resolve_location()` to fix |
| `OFFER_EXPIRED` (410) | Business | Search again for fresh offers |
| `PAYMENT_REQUIRED` (402) | Business | Attach a card: `letsfg setup-payment` (or pay via MPP on the 402 challenge) |
| `FARE_CHANGED` (409) | Business | Re-unlock to get current price |

```python
from letsfg import LetsFG, OfferExpiredError, PaymentRequiredError

try:
    unlocked = bt.unlock(offer_id)
except OfferExpiredError:
    # Airline sold the seats — search again
    flights = bt.search(origin, dest, date)
except PaymentRequiredError:
    # No card on file — attach one (or pay via MPP crypto on the 402 challenge)
    print("Attach a card: letsfg setup-payment")
```

## Search Flags

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--return` / `-r` | _(one-way)_ | Return date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `--adults` / `-a` | `1` | Number of adults (1–9) |
| `--children` | `0` | Children (2–11 years) |
| `--cabin` / `-c` | _(any)_ | `M` economy, `W` premium, `C` business, `F` first |
| `--max-stops` / `-s` | `2` | Max stopovers (0–4) |
| `--currency` | `EUR` | Currency code |
| `--limit` / `-l` | `20` | Max results (1–100) |
| `--sort` | `price` | `price` or `duration` |
| `--json` / `-j` | | JSON output |

## Safety

| Operation | Cost | Safe to Retry | Idempotent |
|-----------|------|---------------|------------|
| `search` | Free | Yes | Yes |
| `resolve_location` | Free | Yes | Yes |
| `unlock` | **[Developer API only]** Legacy — not part of the agent flow | No | No |
| `book` | Ticket price | Only with `idempotency_key` | With key: yes |
